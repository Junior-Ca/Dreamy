Vertical Prototype Instructions

To bootup the vertical prototype, click the 'Vertical Prototype' link. You can also boot it up within 'Vertical Project' in the Figma board by selecting 'Preview'

For the vertical prototype, we implemented 3 sections:

1. Graph interface in 'Statistics' section
2. Breathig and Affirmation exercises in the 'Fall Asleep' section
3. Audio search and playback menu in 'Discovery'

Statistics

To operate the graph input, conduct the following:

1. Navigate to 'Statistics' from any section.
2. Input '8' from your keyboard to input number of hours slept.
    - there should be an output '8' on the input box
    -if there is no output, try clicking on the screen and trying again (Figma can be strange with keyboard inputs sometimes)
3. Press the curly left arrou button on the right side of the input box to confirm your selection.
4. Notice the updated graph with the newly updated point.
5*. To test out the error message for this feature, simply type the letter 'n' from your keyboard and view the Error Message underlined in red appear on the input box.

Statistics

To operate with the meditation feature, conduct the following:

1. Navigate to 'Fall Asleep' from any section.
2. On the meditation welcome page, click 'Agree', which will route you to the activity.
3. When directed to the activity, you will see a spinning circle and a countdown in the middle, along with breathing instructions at the bottom of the circle. Play along with this feature in your own time if you wish.
4. To route to the affirmations section, click the button titled 'Affirmations' at the bottom of the screen, right next to the button 'Breathing'.
5. Repeat exercises mentioned in step 3 if you wish.

Discovery

To operate with the audio query feature, conduct the following:

1. Navigate to 'Discovery' from any section.
2. Once landed, route to the audio playback menu page by clicking on the audio 'Bedtime For Frances' (first in the list), and go back via the back button
3. To handle the query, type the following keys on your keyboard exactly in the order below:
    - 'J'
    - 'K'
    - 'Space'
    - 'R'
    ~This will output the string 'Jk r'
    To go erase the most recently pressed key, simply press 'Backspace' and this will erase the letter

    * To test out the error handling: write the sequence of letters above, but replace 'R' with the letter 'L', creating the string 'Jk l'

    Another query can be made, by doing the steps above, but with the letters 'B', then 'E', then 'D' (make sure the search bar is completely empty)

Signout

Once finished, the user can 'signout' by accesing the sidebar, along with a confirmation message.
